INSTALLATION OF Fuse::Simple
============================

To install this module, run the usual "simple mantra" of standard
steps for installing most Perl modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Or you may use the CPAN.pm module, which will automatically execute
these steps for you.

If you are on a windoze box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make',
but as far as I know there is no FUSE for windoze, so good luck!

I am not aware of a FUSE for MacOS either, but MacOS X is based on
BSD, so you never know...
